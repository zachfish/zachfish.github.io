		Hi! My name is Zach Fish, and it's a pleasure to meet you! 

		Originally from Los Angeles, California, since I was a little kid I always wanted to create and innovate, consistently writing down new inventions and optimizations. This natural desire lead me to fall in love with computer science when I took the Intro to C.S. class at Yeshiva University, where I am currently a Junior. Since that first intro class, I have worked on several projects, was a HackYU winner, and took part in an intense Industrial Software Engineering mentorship program. I plan to graduate in May 2023 with a B.S. in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science, and a minor in mathematics. In addition to computer science, I love continuously learning new skills, whether that be mastering the Adobe Creative Suite, how to create an effective social media marketing strategy, or even how to skateboard. 

		I am looking for a position where I can work hard, be apart of a team, learn as much as possible from co-workers, and continue growing in my computer science journey.

		</p>
