		<p class = "about_me_text"> 

		Hi! My name is Zach Fish, and it's a pleasure to meet you! 

		Originally from Los Angeles, California, since I was a little kid I always wanted to create and innovate, consistently writing down new inventions and optimizations. This natural desire lead me to fall in love with computer science when I took the Intro to C.S. class at Yeshiva University, where I am currently a Junior. I plan to graduate May 2023 with a B.S. in Computer Science with a specilization in Data Science, and a minor in mathematics.

		I am looking for a position where I can work hard, be apart of a team, learn as much as possible from co-workers, and continue growing in my computer science journey.

		</p>
