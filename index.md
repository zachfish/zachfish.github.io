About Me {.center .topSpace}
--------

Hi! My name is Zach Fish, and it's a pleasure to meet you! Originally
from Los Angeles, California, since I was a little kid I always wanted
to create and innovate, consistently journaling new inventions and
optimizations. This natural desire lead me to fall in love with computer
science when I took the Intro to C.S. class at Yeshiva University, where
I am currently a Junior. I plan to graduate May 2023 with B.S. in
Computer Science with a specilization in Data Science, and a minor in
mathematics. I am looking for a position where I can work hard, be apart
of a team, learn as much as possible from co-workers, and continue
growing in my computer science journey.
